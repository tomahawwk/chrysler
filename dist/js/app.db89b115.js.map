Reynolds, known for developing Dreamland at Coney Island, hired architect William Van Alen to design a speculative skyscraper, to be called the Reynolds Building, for a site on the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street. The project was planned to rise 67 stories and 808 feet. In October 1928, the land lease and plans were acquired by the automobile magnate Walter P. Chrysler, who was in the news as Time Magazine \"Man of the Year\" for 1928.\r\n                router-link.link-border.link.circle__link(to=\"/\") Локация\r\n        .pic__item.dop-pic.observe\r\n          .picture\r\n            img(src=\"./pics/part-2/part-2_1.jpg\")\r\n\r\n      .main-block.layer-trigger.observe.trigger-2(\r\n        data-trigger=\"2\",\r\n        data-lax-preset=\"lazy-200\"\r\n      )\r\n      .main-block.horizontal-content.horizontal-content-3\r\n        Roller(:count=\"12\", :type=\"1\")\r\n        .main-block__content\r\n          h2.title-big.title-observe.observe\r\n            .title__part\r\n              span S\r\n              span I\r\n              span L\r\n              span V\r\n              span E\r\n              span R\r\n            .title__part\r\n              span S\r\n              span P\r\n              span I\r\n              span K\r\n              span E\r\n          .description__area\r\n            .description.observe\r\n              span.count 003\r\n              .description__part\r\n                .p-1.text.text-observe\r\n                  p On October 16, 1929, the 185-foot-long spire, assembled in\r\n                  P secret in the building’s tower, emerged from its chrome cocoon\r\n                  p and was bolted triumphantly into place.
